Even if the output is still visible from when you ran the cells in your previous session, the kernel starts in a fresh state so you'll need to reload the data, etc. on a new session.\n",

Try reloading the data and run all of the processing steps one by one in order to make sure that you are working with the same variables and data that are at each quiz stage.\n",
